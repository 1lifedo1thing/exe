// The Dict app's dictionary.
//
// An entry is looked up in the node's own dictionary, ~/.exe/dict.db, and
// written when it is not there: an ephemeral Codex session (threads of
// codex app-server's that are never saved and never join the resume list)
// on gpt-6-astra, its answer held to a JSON schema, then kept, so every
// later lookup of the same word in the same pair of languages is answered
// from the database. Before the entry, a quick spelling pass (medium
// effort, a few seconds) reads an obvious typo as the word it stands for:
// that word is what gets written and kept, and the typo is remembered as
// one, never given a page of its own; a lookup that is no word at all ends
// there with suggestions, before the long session (xhigh). A host without
// the Codex CLI can still read what is kept, and says "No Usable LLM
// Backend" for the rest.
//
// GET /v1/dict?from=en&to=zh&q=word answers a kept entry — for a known
// typo, its word's, with "corrected" saying what was typed (exact=1 reads
// the text as typed) — and 404 when there is none. POST /v1/dict with
// {"from","to","q"} answers newline-delimited JSON: a kept entry at once,
// as one {"entry":…} line. Otherwise the session is watched as it works:
// {"writing":true,"model","effort","wait"}, then {"step":{"t","kind",…}}
// lines — t the seconds since the session began; kind "session" (it
// started), "spell" and "spelled" (the spelling pass began, and its
// "verdict" on the "typed" text: "word", "typo" with the "word" it stands
// for — its key, and "shown", as the pass spelled it — or "unknown"),
// "think" and "thought" (a reasoning pass, by "pass", began and ended),
// "summary" (a line of a pass's summary as it stands: "pass", "part",
// "text"), "answer" (the entry begins), "usage" (the tokens spent,
// "usage"), "retry" ("text") — and {"text":…} lines, the entry's JSON a
// fragment at a time; a {"wait":seconds} line every few seconds besides, as
// a write takes a minute or two, longer than Cloudflare holds a silent
// request. The last line is the {"entry":…} (with "written" and the
// session's "tokens", and "corrected" when the lookup was a typo), or
// {"notfound":true,"suggestions":[…]} when the lookup is no word of the
// source language (that answer is not kept), or {"error":…}. "exact":true
// in the body skips the spelling pass and looks the text up as typed. Two
// lookups of one entry share one session, the later one reading every line
// from the start — a plain lookup only a session whose spelling it can
// trust, an exact one only a session writing its text as typed (the rules
// on dictFlight); the "writing" line's "q" is the word the session writes.
// A session outlives the window that started it, and what it writes is
// kept for the next lookup.
